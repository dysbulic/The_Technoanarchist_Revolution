I keep remembering a sci-fi short story I read years ago.

A capsule appears in a laboratory with an old insane man in it. As time passes they recognize that he is aging backwards.

Eventually he communicates how to build the capsule and switches places with the him that has been aging normally simultaneously.

I've had that sense of a story told backwards for a while.

I remember months of being enamored with the fame that has to accomany being the one to start Babylon burning.

If this works like it could, we'll end up in a theocracy, The Caliphate, and I'll be the prophet to succeed Mohammed.

As much as it seems like I would have set out for something so grandiose, it just recently fell into place.

I thought I was going to end hunger.

Multi-master stores are a database technology that allow independent instances to be seamlessly composited.

My idea is to publish the functioning of the supply chain in [one of these](http://ipfs.io) then use computers to work out the systemic origins of hunger and shelter.

Recently, though I started focusing on [the reality of the experience of The Holy Spirit](http://www.amazon.com/Why-God-Wont-Go-Away/dp/034544034X) and absurdity of the Virgin Birth.
