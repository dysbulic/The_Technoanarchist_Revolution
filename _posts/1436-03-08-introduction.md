I keep remembering Ian Watson's *The Very Slow Time Machine*, which I read years ago.

A capsule appears in a laboratory with an old insane man in it. As time passes they recognize that he is aging backwards.

Eventually he communicates how to build the capsule and switches places with the him that has been aging normally simultaneously.

I've had that sense of a story told backwards for a while.

Like the title says, this is *The Revoultion Will Be Televised*. Some group of people start working on a concrete plan for restructuing the systemic sources of suffering and publishing as much data as possible about their revolutionary work.

First and formost are war and hunger.

To work toward the end of war, we saturate a region with communications infrastructure: mobile phones, solar chargers, and network-providing blimps.

We connect that in-country network with as complex an exterior information as necessary to build a successful reistance,

The issues are twofold:

* We drop in bunches of phones and Da'esh destroys them all, killing anyone who stands up. I dunno, much of this depends on what percentage of the population is enamored with the violence. Phones could spread through other means if this was the case.
* Forces insisting on violence will coopt the equipment and use it to further nefarious plots. There should be technical means for mitigating this: fingerprint locking, cause erase passcodes, and the like.

We could set up banks of native speakers. The first contact with a phone is just press a button and get an operator.

To address the systemic causes of hunger, I would like to open access to the data stores backing the industries that make up the supply chain. 

Multi-master stores are a database technology that allow independent instances to be seamlessly composited.

If the storage for all the retail point-of-sale systems were in [one of these](http://ipfs.io), they could all be combined to provide a real-time view of the market.
