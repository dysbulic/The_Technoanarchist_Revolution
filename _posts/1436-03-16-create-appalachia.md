Create Appalachia is the vision of Cher Cornett for a combination makerspace / gallery.

I learned about it through [The Oaks Castle](http://dhappy.org/.../geo/usa/37601/South%20Roan/1416/). Ultimately, that building sold to [someone else](https://www.facebook.com/sylviapolitesinger).

Cher has reset her sights on 71 Wilson which we went to visit on Monday. The Castle is 14,200 square feet. The Enviro Center is 30,000.
